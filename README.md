# Landkind Developer Candidate Test

This project is designed to allow you to show off your JS developing skills. Provided is a fresh out of the box create-react-app, with the **[Esri JS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/index.html)** and map already loaded and ready to go. Use these **[wire frames](https://gpsitnz.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/EYF24WqbsG1ImTHG-L8Ks5oBoc4DUDDgZqXDplGJGsjF-Q)** to create a web application to the best of your ability! We are interested in:

  - Standard coding style across the entire project.
  - Unit testing.
  - Useful comments.
  - Problem solving skills.
  - Maybe a little bit of black magic.

We expect you should be able to get this boiler plate up and running without any issue! If you have any questions about the wire frames please feel free to ask, and remember Have fun!!! ü§òüèª

## How I did it:

Gray scale map, zoom and center:
 -  Read through tutorial 'Display a map'


## To do:

 - Query feature layer: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/query-a-feature-layer-sql/

 - Get X and Y co-ordinates from feature service and place blue or red pins as required.

 - conditional to determine class/colour of point

 - Create pop up to display name of pin: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/add-a-point-line-and-polygon/#create-a-pop-up


## Notes as I go

 - map used is NZ_WaterQuality: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c3337bfc8f964688856b36a4651b66cf

 - feature layer is NZ_WaterQuality: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b2a3544a3dc04ef48542a270a2fafb39

 - feature layer also has a Point Layer (feature service?) NZ_WaterQuality with URL: https://services1.arcgis.com/YAnRDYVL1tmpajaA/arcgis/rest/services/NZ_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/0

- Layer has a table that can be queried using SQL
